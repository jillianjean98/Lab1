"Got Light?" MVP
Lindsey Ma and Jillian Ritchey

In this game, you are attempting to bring light to a village of Sprites.
Level Interaction:
Arrow keys- move cursor around the workspace
Letter Keys- select/deselect items from the toolbox (based on the underlined letter in the label), select options for multiple choice question
Space- place the currently selected item in the square the cursor is over
Delete/Backspace- remove items from squares in the workspace
Enter Key- when prompted, advances to the next level

Q and / at the same time - shortcut to complete a level- this was included for testing purposes, and we thought it might be helpful to leave it in for grading so that the grader could more easily move through levels.

General guidelines:
Only one item can be selected at a time. Selecting another item will deselect the current one.
Only one object can be placed in each grid square. You must delete the previous object to place a new one.
Items will be placed in the square the the cursor is over.
For level 3, the a, b, c, d keys are used to answer the question. Choosing incorrectly twice will require the player to replay level 2. The enter key advances through parts of the level. 


From MVP:

    Level 1: The workspace in the first level will consist of only a generator/battery and an unlit bulb. The only item that will be in the player’s toolbox will be an unlimited amount of wire. This level will have few things cluttering the workspace and toolbox so that players only really have one option: to use the wire to connect the generator and the lightbulb, and then back again to complete a circuit. There will be an unlimited amount of wire to create as little challenge as possible for this level. This will show students what the most simple circuit is like. This level will act as a base for the rest of the levels.</li>
    Level 2: In this level, the workspace will begin with a generator and a lightbulb a certain distance apart. The student will be given wire that is connected from the generator to the bulb, then from the bulb back towards the generator, but there is a break in the middle of the wire between the bulb and the generator that is a length of one grid unit. They don’t have any more wire to repair it. Instead, the player’s toolbox will contain some seemingly random items (ie. a block of metal, a rock, etc.), and the student can experiment with these items to see which one can be used to conduct electricity and complete the circuit. Through this, the level will teach both insulators and conductors.
    Level 3: In this level, there will be some premise that will explain that a villager who they previously built a circuit for wanted the lightbulb to be further away from the generator, so tried to build their own circuit. They didn’t have any more wire, so they replaced it with string. Now the light bulb isn’t lighting up. In order to complete the level, they need to select a response for the villager of why their circuit didn’t work. They will be presented with a multiple choice option, where one response will (correctly) be that they were using an insulator to connect the wire to the bulb, which doesn’t conduct electricity because it’s an insulator.  The player will then have to fix the circuit by replacing the string with either more wire from their toolbox, or a conductor. This level will build off of the difference between conductors and insulators that they learned in the previous level, and make them apply the knowledge.
