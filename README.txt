Lindsey Ma and Jillian Ritchey Lab 2

Mario has 4 animations: Walk, Run, Jump, and Thumbs Up

To walk: press the right/left arrow keys
To run: Hold the shift key then use the right/left arrows to control direction.
To jump: press and hold the space bar
To give a thumbs up: Press and hold Enter/return

To change the animation speed, use the +/= key and the -/_ key to increase/decrease it, respectively.

The other movements (rotation, up/down, changing pivot point) work as implemented in Lab 1.
